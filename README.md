I'm Jacob Eldridge and these are some of my projects. Some projects were not included or are private because they include sensitive data. 
My best languages are Python and Java right now, but I am decent at Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and I am learning a little jQuery syntax with some of my newer projects.
You can contact me at jacob.eldridge.ga@icloud.com
